# üöó CO‚ÇÇ Emission Classification from Vehicles

This project focuses on classifying carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) emissions from vehicles based on relevant features such as engine size, fuel type, and vehicle class. It aims to promote environmental awareness and support sustainable practices by leveraging machine learning for emissions prediction and classification.

## üìå Objective

- Predict or classify CO‚ÇÇ emissions of vehicles using supervised machine learning models.
- Analyze which features (e.g., engine size, fuel type) contribute most to CO‚ÇÇ emission levels.
- Enable policy recommendations for environmentally friendly transportation.

## üìä Dataset

- **Source:** [Your dataset source here, e.g., Kaggle or Government of Canada - Vehicle Emissions Testing Results](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/86ba29c5-5f63-4f63-96d5-8d975c5f91b5)
- **Size:** X records √ó Y features
- **Attributes Include:**
  - Vehicle Make & Model
  - Vehicle Class
  - Engine Size (L)
  - Cylinders
  - Transmission
  - Fuel Type
  - Fuel Consumption (City, Highway, Combined)
  - CO‚ÇÇ Emissions (g/km)

## üß† ML Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- XGBoost (Optional for advanced performance)

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Null value handling
   - Feature encoding (Label/One-hot)
   - Feature scaling (StandardScaler/MinMax)
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Feature distributions
3. **Model Training & Evaluation:**
   - Train-test split (e.g., 80/20)
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix
4. **Classification Output:**
   - Categorized emissions: Low / Medium / High
   - Visualization with bar charts and scatter plots

## üìà Results

| Model                | Accuracy |
|---------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 85%      |
| Decision Tree       | 88%      |
| Random Forest       | 91%      |
| SVM                 | 87%      |
| k-NN                | 84%      |

*Random Forest Classifier achieved the best overall performance.*

## üí° Key Findings

- **Engine Size** and **Fuel Type** are the most influential features.
- CO‚ÇÇ emissions increase linearly with engine displacement.
- Diesel engines tend to emit more CO‚ÇÇ compared to hybrid or electric.
